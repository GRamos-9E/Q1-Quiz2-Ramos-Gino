	<center><h1>Cars: A quick Summary</h1></center>
	<p> Cars is a Pixar animated movie that was made in 2006 starring Owen Wilson as Lightning Mcqueen, Larry The Cable Guy as Tow Mater, Paul Newman as Doc Hudson and Bonnie Hunt as Sally. Join us with up and coming racing star Lightning Mcqueen as he journeys around the small town of Radiator springs after being lost and discovers a new identity as he meets new friends such as Tow Mater and Sally. During his stint at Radiator Springs, he changes his old arrogant attitude thanks to Doc Hudson, a racer himself who sadly retired early due to a crash that ended his career at a young age. Before Radiator Springs, Mcqueen was caught up in an epic title race with the legendary "The King" and the even more arrogant "Chick Hicks". During that race, Mcqueen did not change his tires and got karma for it by almost losing the race and ending up in a 3-way tie with a final race in California to decide The Piston Cup. He was supposed to go to California by truck until Mack, his truck driver accidentaly opened the back of his trailer and lost Mcqueen and that is how we got here. </p>

	<p> During the movie he was breaking out as a star as despite it being his rookie year, he challenged for the Piston Cup. He had a problem, his ego which almost costed him his title as he did not change his already degraded tires and only refueled. He redeemed himself in the rematch race after Chick Hicks crashed The King, Mcqueen gave up first place and pushed king to 2nd place getting 3rd place. </p>

	<p>Tow mater is the comic relief in this move and I really like him because of it. (this was all my opinion)</p>
